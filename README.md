# Battleship
This project was assigned in my Structure of Programming Languages class in order to showcase my ability to code in C++. The program is designed to simulate a game of battleship against an AI that randomly chooses locations to fire at.
## How to Run:
- Compile main.cpp and board.cpp together or find a DE that can simply run the program.
- Follow the instructions the game gives you.
